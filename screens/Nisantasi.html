                        gain valuable
                        experiences that have shaped my educational path. My time at the university can be divided into
                        several key phases, each
                        contributing to my growth and development as a student.</p>

                    <p>My academic journey commenced in the 2020-2021 academic year, where I began my studies with the
                        Hazırlık-I (Y) program.
                        During this preparatory year, I focused on building a strong foundation for my future studies.
                        Although my grades during
                        this period were not reflected in GPA points, this phase provided me with essential skills and
                        knowledge to succeed in
                        my subsequent years.</p>

                        undergraduate
                        journey with great enthusiasm. During the fall semester, I took a variety of courses, including
                        "Communication Skills
                        and Academic Reporting I," "Physics I," "Mathematics I," "Ataturk's Principles and History of
                        Revolution I," and
                        "Introduction to Software Engineering." This semester laid the groundwork for my academic
                        endeavors
                        and introduced me to
